# Regression Analysis Classwork Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for my classwork on Regression Analysis! This repository is dedicated to the various projects and exercises I have completed as part of my coursework in predictive modeling using regression techniques. The focus is on applying supervised machine learning methods to structured data with continuous target variables.

## Module Description
This module involves an in-depth exploration of regression analysis, a statistical method for modeling the relationship between dependent (target) and independent (feature) variables. The coursework covers several key aspects of regression analysis:

- **Data Acquisition**: Acquiring and importing data from SQL databases into Pandas for analysis.
- **Data Summarization**: Utilizing descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to understand the data.
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing data, including handling missing values and splitting datasets into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Formulating hypotheses, visualizing data relationships, and performing statistical tests.
- **Preprocessing for Modeling**: Encoding categorical variables and scaling features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques for feature selection and addressing the curse of dimensionality.
- **Regression Modeling**: Building and evaluating models like simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.
- **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Comparing different models and selecting the best performer for final testing.

## Coursework Contents
The repository includes the following key components:

1. **Structured Data Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts for analyzing structured data using regression techniques.
2. **Visualization Scripts**: Code for creating detailed visualizations of data and model performance.
3. **Modeling Notebooks**: Implementation of various regression models, including their evaluation and selection.
4. **Data Files**: Sample datasets used for training and testing the models.
5. **Additional Resources**: Supplementary materials and references used throughout the coursework.

## Learning Objectives
- Master the fundamentals of regression analysis in a supervised machine learning context.
- Develop proficiency in handling and analyzing structured data.
- Gain practical experience in model building, evaluation, and selection.
